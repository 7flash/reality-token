Token is used as a means of calculating, storing, accounting for the transfer of human values through training, communication, the provision of services and goods. Token has the properties of a digital replica of a person and his reality.
At the same time, the token does not have the properties of securities or other assets. He is not tied as an asset to the reality and inner values of man.
In accordance with the works of Victor Batalov and his colleagues of quantum geneticists, the token-transformer duplicates the transformation of the reality of a person and his values.
The Token functionally reflects or symbolizes the visible and invisible reality. It is the applied basis for a new alternative economy of reproduction of living organisms and systems with their values inherited.
